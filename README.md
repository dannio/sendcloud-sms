# Sendcloud SMS
## Brief

This is a fork off https://github.com/heckpsi-lab/sendcloud-sms

I extended the original to include "get" and "list"

`sendcloud-sms` an unofficial support for developers to send SMS with SendCloud API in Ruby. The gem packaged the official Restful API to a better ruby-style methods.

## Installation

For scaling projects using `bundler` to manage the gems, just add one line to your `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem 'sendcloud-sms'
```

And then execute in shell:

```shell
bundle
```

Or install it yourself via gem as:

```shell
gem install sendcloud-sms
```

## Getting Started

### Config

This gem is both rails friendly and pure ruby friendly. You could config the gem via the following three ways.

#### For Rails Developers

Create `config/initializers/sendcloud-sms.rb`

```ruby
SendCloud::SMS.auth('user', 'api_key')
```

It's ready to go.

#### For Other Developers

Add the following line before calling any method to send SMS.

```ruby
SendCloud::SMS.auth('user', 'api_key')
```

#### Using Config File

If you are in need of using seperated configuration of different environments. You could first create `config/sendcloud.yml` or whatever file you want with the following YAML.

```yaml
development:
  user: user for development
  api_key: api_key for development
production:
  user: user for production
  api_key: api_key for production
```

Load it before calling any other method

##### In Development

```ruby
SendCloud::SMS.load!('./config/sendcloud.yml', :development)
```

##### In Production

```ruby
SendCloud::SMS.load!('./config/sendcloud.yml', :production)
```

##### For Rails Developers

```ruby
SendCloud::SMS.load!('./config/sendcloud.yml', (Rails.env.development ? :development: :production))
```

### Send SMS

parameter `phone` could be either an array of phone numbers or one phone number

#### Usage:
Send
```ruby
SendCloud::SMS.send(template_id, phone, vars)
```

Get
```ruby
SendCloud::SMS.get(template_id)
```

List
```ruby
SendCloud::SMS.list
```

Update
```ruby
SendCloud::SMS.update(template_id, template_name, template_text, sign_name, sign_position_str, sms_type_str)
```

Create
```ruby
SendCloud::SMS.create(template_name, template_text, sign_name, sign_position_str, sms_type_str)
```

Delete
```ruby
SendCloud::SMS.delete(template_id)
```

Submit - Sendcloud requires you to submit the template for approval before usage
```ruby
SendCloud::SMS.submit(template_id)
```

#### Example:

```ruby
SendCloud::SMS.send(1234, '18000000000', {veri_code: '1234'})
SendCloud::SMS.send(4321, %w'18000000000 13800000000 13700000000', {broadcast: 'Hello SMS!'})

SendCloud::SMS.create('Welcome template', 'Welcome to our company, %name%!', 'Signature name', 0, 1)
```

### Send Voice Message

The SendCloud Voice message is only available for verification code. What's more, it **does not** support receiving an array of phone numbers.

#### Usage:

```ruby
SendCloud::SMS.send_voice(phone, code)
```

#### Example:

```ruby
SendCloud::SMS.send_voice('18000000000', '1234')
```
